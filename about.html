    <h1 class="title"> ABOUT US <h1>
    <h2>
      Hello, we are Chloe and Riley, the senior students who are about to graduate 
      from UNC-Chapel Hill, we are the founder & co-founder of R Events. 
    </h2>
    
    <p>
     We met during our designing class. Then we comed up with the idea that we both have strong passion in designing events. 
     We've worked at desginers' companies before where we have accumulated a lot of relevant professional experience in planning events. As two millennial girls, we like to understand the preferences, aesthetics of contemporary women. Marriage, as a life event for all people, tends to leave a lifetime of memories. We want all people to realize their dream world on their wedding day, so we discussed and finally created this company together with the aim of providing all women with weddings that they will never forget.
